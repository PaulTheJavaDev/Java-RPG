Hey there,

Yes, I sadly used AI to write the last code.
I sadly could't add anything to the code since I didn't write it myself.
Now with this project, I wrote it almost entirely by myself.
Of course I didn't really know how to do everything, but with a bit of research I really got the hang of the solution.

Example: how to decrease the amount of a Value in a Key in a HashMap, now I know that I have to put the same Key - 1 inside it and I absolutely love getting to know new features.

Future:
In the near future, after this project, I wanna get to know how to work with a Java FrameWork
